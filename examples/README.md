# Examples

This directory contains examples of `data_visualization` usage.
All the scripts represent the same layout: a plot with a 2x1 spatial subplot representing a map with cones and a
trajectory, and a 1x1 temporal subplot representing the speed of the car, and another 1x1 temporal subplot representing
the steering of the car.

You can find below samples of the plots generated by the scripts.
